MID-TERM PROJECT: FOOTBALL PLAYER PRICE CALCULATOR


Team Members: Samsudeen Afolabi, Elisa Cerdá Doñate




PROJECT SCOPE: Creating a model to calculate the estimated price for football players across top 5 leagues in Europe (Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, and France) based on the 20/21 football season. For this, a dataset with parameters, such as player age, position, club, goals, or assists, will be used.




PROJECT STEPS:
Day 1- Dataset exploration, description , cleaning , wrangling and EDA
   - Shape description
   - Column description
   - Assessment of redundant columns
   - Dropping of redundant columns
   - Assessment of variable types (numerical, categorical ordinal and categorical nominal)
   - Definition of independent variables
   - Definition of target variable
   - Look for NaN values
   - Removal of rows with NaN values
   - Merging of weight, height and right/left columns from the fifa dataset with the player_value_data dataset
   - Homogenization of data types within columns
   - Dispersion of target variable
   - Plotting of key variables that are thought to affect the most to the target variable




Day 2 


   - Model building 
   - X-y splitting
   - Numerical variables scaling with chosen scaler based on target variable dispersion
   - Nominal categorical variables hot encoding
   - Ordinal categorical variables ordinal encoding
   - Data transforming




Day 3- Coefficient weighing 
   - Coefficient A/B testing
   - Calculation of p-values and confidence intervals
   - Definition of key variables on target variable
   - Plotting of key variables' weight




Day 4  - Player value calculation and putting together presentation 


   - Example for 10 players with different variables
   - Example for 1 single player and price variability when tuning variable
