INVENTORY MANAGEMENT ANALYSIS

Samsudeen Olawale Afolabi


PROJECT SCOPE:  The project's objective is to generate actionable insights aimed at enhancing inventory management practices, cutting costs, and elevating the overall customer experience by ensuring real-time product availability. The key focus areas include:



1) Optimizing Inventory Levels:

Provide recommendations for optimal inventory levels encompassing essential factors like reorder points and Economic Order Quantity (EOQ).
EOQ will be determined to identify the ideal order quantity, minimizing overall inventory costs and mitigating the risk of stockouts.
Inventory Management Strategy:


2) Offer strategic recommendations for process improvements within the inventory management lifecycle:

Propose enhancements in procurement and production processes to increase operational efficiency.
Develop a comprehensive inventory management strategy to align with organizational goals, streamline processes, and enhance overall effectiveness.


By addressing these aspects, the project aims to foster efficient inventory management, reduce operational expenses, and ensure a seamless customer experience through consistent real-time product availability.







PROJECT STEPS: 

1)  Dataset Exploration, Cleaning, Wrangling, and EDA


Data Loading:


i)  Use Python (Pandas library) to load datasets (Purchase_prices, Beginning_inventory,End_inventory, Invoice_purchases, Purchases, Sales). 



Data Cleaning and Merging:


i) Assess and clean redundant columns in each dataset.


ii) Drop redundant columns.


iii) Merge datasets based on common columns where applicable.


iv) Handle missing values (NaN) in the merged datasets.



Data Wrangling:


i) Categorize variables into relevant types.


ii)  Define key metrics for inventory management.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):


i) Visualize key variables using Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn).


ii) Explore dispersion of key metrics.




 2) SQL Phase: Data Analysis and Key Insights


Database Creation:
i) Create a SQL database and tables  for the cleaned and merged datasets

 
 Querying:


i) Use SQL queries to analyze sales and inventory data.


ii) Evaluate supplier performance with SQL.


iii) Calculate inventory turnover ratios.


iv) Perform demand forecasting analysis using SQL.



Identify Slow-Moving Items:


i)  SQL to identify slow-moving items.


  3)Tableau Phase:  Presentation and Recommendations


Data Connection:


i) Connect Tableau to the SQL database.


Create Visualizations:


i) Design visualizations (charts, graphs) in Tableau to showcase key insights.


ii) Visualize trends, seasonality, and product performance.


Dashboard Creation:

i) Build interactive dashboards in Tableau to present findings effectively.


Optimization Strategies Visualization:


i) Use Tableau to visualize proposed strategies for optimizing stock levels,managing suppliers, and improving inventory efficiency.


Cost Reduction Opportunities Visualization:


i) Visualize opportunities for cost reduction in inventory management processes.


Enhancing Customer Experience Visualization:


i) Showcase strategies to enhance overall customer experience through improved inventory management



 4) Final Presentation Preparation: Insights and Recommendations:


i) Compile key insights from Python and SQL phases.

ii) Prepare actionable recommendations for inventory management improvement. 



This plan considers the exploration, cleaning, and analysis of six datasets, providing a comprehensive approach to inventory management analysis.
